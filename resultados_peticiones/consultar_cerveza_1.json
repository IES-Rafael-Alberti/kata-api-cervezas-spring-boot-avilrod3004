  "descript": "Our take on a classic summer ale.  A toast to weeds, rays, and summer haze.  A light, crisp ale for mowing lawns, hitting lazy fly balls, and communing with nature, Hocus Pocus is offered up as a summer sacrifice to clodless days.\r\n\r\nIts malty sweetness finishes tart and crisp and is best apprediated with a wedge of orange.",
